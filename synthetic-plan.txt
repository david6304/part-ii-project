Plan for comprehensive evaluation using synthetic data from bnlearn

Three types of data needed: Categorical, Continuous, Mix of both types
For robustness testing add random flips to categorical, noise to gaussian. 
Test different sample sizes 1000, 5000, 10,000. Different sized networks as well.

Maybe perturb edges.

Mask features to imitate missing data.

Consider do-interventions
